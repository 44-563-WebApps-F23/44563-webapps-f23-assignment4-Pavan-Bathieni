        </h1>
        <h3>A Doll’s House Act 1 and Henrik Ibsen</h3>
            <h3>HELMER.</h3>
            <p>This time I needn’t sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn’t
            ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands</p>
            
            <h3>NORA.</h3>
            <p>[clapping her hands]</p> <p>No, Torvald, I needn’t any longer, need I! It’s
            wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! <p>[Taking his arm.]</p>Now I will
            tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.
            As soon as Christmas is over<p>[A bell rings in the hall.]</p> There’s the
            bell. <p>[She tidies the room a little.]</p> There’s some one at the door.
            What a nuisance!</p>
            
            <h3>MAID.</h3>
            <p>[in the doorway]</p> <p>A lady to see you, ma’am,—a stranger.</p>
            
            <h3>MRS LINDE.</h3>
            <p>[in a dejected and timid voice]</p> <p>How do you do, Nora?</p>
            
            <h3>RANK.</h3>
            <p>Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse
            yourself with our entertainments?</p>
            
            <h3>NURSE.</h3>
            <p>The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma.</p>
            
            <h3>KROGSTAD.</h3>
            <p>Maybe. But matters of business—such business as you and I have had
            together—do you think I don’t understand that? Very well. Do as you
            please. But let me tell you this—if I lose my position a second time,
            you shall lose yours with me.</p>
