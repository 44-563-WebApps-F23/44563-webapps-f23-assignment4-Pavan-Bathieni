            <p class="speech">This time I needn’t sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn’t
            ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands</p>
            
            <h3 class="nora">NORA.</h3>
            <p class="direction">[clapping her hands]</p> <p class="speech">No, Torvald, I needn’t any longer, need I! It’s
            wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! <p class="direction">[Taking his arm.]</p>Now I will
            tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.
            As soon as Christmas is over<p class="direction">[A bell rings in the hall.]</p> There’s the
            bell. <p class="direction">[She tidies the room a little.]</p> There’s some one at the door.
            What a nuisance!</p>
            
            <h3 class="maid">MAID.</h3>
            <p class="direction">[in the doorway]</p> <p class="speech">A lady to see you, ma’am,—a stranger.</p>
            
            <h3 class="linde">MRS LINDE.</h3>
            <p class="direction">[in a dejected and timid voice]</p> <p class="speech">How do you do, Nora?</p>
            
            <h3 class="rank">RANK.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse
            yourself with our entertainments?</p>
            
            <h3 class="nurse">NURSE.</h3>
            <p class="speech">The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma.</p>
            
            <h3 class="krogstad">KROGSTAD.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Maybe. But matters of business—such business as you and I have had
            together—do you think I don’t understand that? Very well. Do as you
            please. But let me tell you this—if I lose my position a second time,
            you shall lose yours with me.</p>
