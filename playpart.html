            HELMER.
            This time I needn’t sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn’t
            ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands—
            
            NORA.
            _[clapping her hands]_. No, Torvald, I needn’t any longer, need I! It’s
            wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! _[Taking his arm.]_ Now I will
            tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.
            As soon as Christmas is over—_[A bell rings in the hall.]_ There’s the
            bell. _[She tidies the room a little.]_ There’s some one at the door.
            What a nuisance!
            
            MAID.
            _[in the doorway]_. A lady to see you, ma’am,—a stranger.
            
            MRS LINDE.
            _[in a dejected and timid voice]_. How do you do, Nora?
            
            RANK.
            Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse
            yourself with our entertainments?
            
            NURSE.
            The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Maybe. But matters of business—such business as you and I have had
            together—do you think I don’t understand that? Very well. Do as you
            please. But let me tell you this—if I lose my position a second time,
            you shall lose yours with me. _[He bows, and goes out through the
            hall.]_
